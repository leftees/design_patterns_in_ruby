# Adapter
This pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

An adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real world definition for an adapter. The Adapter pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
