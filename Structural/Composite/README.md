# Composite
This pattern composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object.

The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
