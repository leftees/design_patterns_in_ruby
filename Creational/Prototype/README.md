# Prototype
This pattern creates objects by cloning an existing object.

It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to:

* avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the abstract factory pattern does.
* avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the 'new' keyword) when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.
