# Singleton
This pattern restricts object creation for a class to only one instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a [singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics)).
