The classic 23 design patterns from the [Gang of Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) implemented in
Ruby.

Divided by type, we have such a structure:

* Behavioral
  * [Chain of Responsibility](Behavioral/Chain of Responsibility)
  * [Command](Behavioral/Command)
  * [Interpreter](Behavioral/Interpreter)
  * [Iterator](Behavioral/Iterator)
  * [Mediator](Behavioral/Mediator)
  * [Memento](Behavioral/Memento)
  * Observer
  * State
  * Strategy
  * Template Method
  * Visitor
* Creational
  * Abstract Factory
  * Builder
  * Factory Method
  * Prototype
  * [Singleton](Creational/Singleton)
* Structural
  * Adapter
  * Bridge
  * Composite
  * Decorator
  * Facade
  * Flyweight
  * Proxy

All sources are tested against Ruby 2. [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) compliant.
