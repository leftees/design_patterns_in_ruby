# Observer
This pattern is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event. In this pattern, an object called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. The Observer pattern is also a key part in the familiar model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
