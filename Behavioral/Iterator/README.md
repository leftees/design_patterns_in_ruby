# Iterator
Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. In this pattern, an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
